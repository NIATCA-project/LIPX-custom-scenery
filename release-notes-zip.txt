----------------------------------------
HOW TO INSTALL ON MICROSOFT® WINDOWS®:
1) Unzip the package to a directory of your choice.
2) Click on Start->Run, type "C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\
   flightgear.org\" and click OK; replace "<your username>" with your
   username.
3) Delete all files named "navdata_x_y.cache" (where "x" and "y" are
   numbers) and "navdata.cache". This will force FlightGear to reload
   the scenery data on next launch.
4) Open FlightGear Launcher and go to the first page.
5) Click on the "Add" button next to the FG_SCENERY box and choose the
   directory where you unzipped the scenery.
6) Using the up arrow next to the FG_SCENERY box, put the newly added
   directory to the top of the list, so that FlightGear will use the
   custom scenery instead of the default one.
7) Launch FlightGear as usual.

HOW TO INSTALL ON MAC OS X:
1) Open the FlightGear Launcher and choose Advanced Features -> Others
   -> Install Add-On data.

2) Delete the files ~/.flightgear/navdata_x_y.cache (where "x" and "y" are
   numbers) and ~/.flightgear/navdata.cache.
3) Add the full path to the directory where you unzipped the scenery to the
   --fg-scenery command line parameter when launching FlightGear. Make sure
   the custom scenery path is the first one in the list.

  even if the complete tile from TerraSync is not installed.
