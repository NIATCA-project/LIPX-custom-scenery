LIPX (Verona/Villafranca) custom scenery
----------------------------------------
SPECIAL NOTES FOR THE GIT VERSION
1. To reduce the size of this repository, all source data (other than the
   airport data in apt.dat) were not included in this repository. You will
   need to download it from the FlightGear map server. We are preparing a
   Makefile to automate the whole process.
2. For ease of use, we have included a pregenerated version of the scenery
   in the "output-pregenerated" directory.
